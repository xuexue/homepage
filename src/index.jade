          p.
            I love math, stats, computer science, machine learning, 
            data visualization, and writing -- though unequally. 
            Variety of experiences makes me a bit of a jack-of-all-trades,
            which may not be a bad thing for a data scientist.

              I prefer not to put myself into the "entrepreneur" bucket,

              Writing non-fiction helps me organize my thoughts.
              Writing fiction forces me to understand humanity.
              The non-fiction content is in a&nbsp;

            I love teaching and public speaking, and hope to become more
            experienced at it.

              During my time studying pure math at University of Waterloo,
              I scored 33 points on the Putnam math contest (where median score
              is 0 most years).&nbsp;

            In 2011, I founded a startup, Polychart. In 2012, I rejected an
            acquisition offer, instead opting for a break-up of the entire
            team.  In 2013, with a re-built team, we were one of five companies
            in the ExtremeStartups accelerator. In late 2013 Polychart
            was open sourced.
